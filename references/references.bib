abstract = {We investigate the consequences of adding unions and complements to attributive concept descriptions employed in terminological knowledge representation languages. It is shown that deciding coherence and subsumption of such descriptions are PSPACE-complete problems that can be decided with linear space.}

title = {Terminological Cycles in a Description Logic with Existential Restrictions},
year = {2003},
publisher = {Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.},
address = {San Francisco, CA, USA},
abstract = {Cyclic definitions in description logics have until now been investigated only for description logics allowing for value restrictions. Even for the most basic language FL0, which allows for conjunction and value restrictions only, deciding subsumption in the presence of terminological cycles is a PSPACE-complete problem. This paper investigates subsumption in the presence of terminological cycles for the language EL, Which allows for conjunction, existential restrictions, and the topconcept. In contrast to the results for FL0., subsumption in EL remains polynomial, independent of whether we use least fixpoint semantics, greatest fixpoint semantics, or descriptive semantics.},

% Introduces the description logic EL++ and shows its complexity

author = {Baader, Franz and Brandt, Sebastian and Lutz, Carsten},
title = {Pushing the EL Envelope},
year = {2005},
publisher = {Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc.},
address = {San Francisco, CA, USA},
abstract = {Recently, it has been shown that the small description logic (DL) EL, which allows for conjunction and existential restrictions, has better algorithmic properties than its counterpart FL0, which allows for conjunction and value restrictions. Whereas the subsumption problem in FL0 becomes already intractable in the presence of acyclic TBoxes, it remains tractable in EL even with general concept inclusion axioms (GCIs). On the one hand, we extend the positive result for EL by identifying a set of expressive means that can be added to EL without sacrificing tractability. On the other hand, we show that basically all other additions of typical DL constructors to EL with GCIs make subsumption intractable, and in most cases even EXPTIME-complete. In addition, we show that subsumption in FL0 with GCIs is EXPTIME-complete.},
