abstract = {Cyclic definitions in description logics have until now been investigated only for description logics allowing for value restrictions. Even for the most basic language FL0, which allows for conjunction and value restrictions only, deciding subsumption in the presence of terminological cycles is a PSPACE-complete problem. This paper investigates subsumption in the presence of terminological cycles for the language EL, Which allows for conjunction, existential restrictions, and the topconcept. In contrast to the results for FL0., subsumption in EL remains polynomial, independent of whether we use least fixpoint semantics, greatest fixpoint semantics, or descriptive semantics.},

abstract = {Recently, it has been shown that the small description logic (DL) EL, which allows for conjunction and existential restrictions, has better algorithmic properties than its counterpart FL0, which allows for conjunction and value restrictions. Whereas the subsumption problem in FL0 becomes already intractable in the presence of acyclic TBoxes, it remains tractable in EL even with general concept inclusion axioms (GCIs). On the one hand, we extend the positive result for EL by identifying a set of expressive means that can be added to EL without sacrificing tractability. On the other hand, we show that basically all other additions of typical DL constructors to EL with GCIs make subsumption intractable, and in most cases even EXPTIME-complete. In addition, we show that subsumption in FL0 with GCIs is EXPTIME-complete.},

abstract = {Abstract A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (“semantic structure”) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising. © 1990 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract={ In this work, we analytically study the peaking phenomenon in the context of linear discriminant analysis in the multivariate Gaussian model under the assumption of a common known covariance matrix. The focus is finite-sample setting where the sample size and observation dimension are comparable. Therefore, in order to study the phenomenon in such a setting, we use an asymptotic technique whereby the number of sample points is kept comparable in magnitude to the dimensionality of observations. The analysis provides a more thorough picture of the phenomenon. In particular, the analysis shows that as long as the Relative Cumulative Efficacy of an additional Feature set (RCEF) is greater (less) than the size of this set, the expected error of the classifier constructed using these additional features will be less (greater) than the expected error of the classifier constructed without them. Our result highlights underlying factors of the peaking phenomenon relative to the classifier used in this study and, at the same time, calls into question the classical wisdom around the peaking phenomenon.},
