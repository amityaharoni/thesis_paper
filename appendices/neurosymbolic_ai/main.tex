\chapter*{\thechapter \quad Neuro-symbolic AI}
\label{appendixB}
In this appendix, we provide a brief introduction to neuro-symbolic AI in relation to knowledge bases.
We would start by providing a motivation for the usage of knowledge bases in AI and then we would
provide a brief introduction to the Neural Neutwork algorithms (NNs) that use knowledge bases.
