			This thesis engages in ideas from different fields of mathematics and
			computer science. Specifically,
			description logics, neuro-symbolic AI, and category theory.
			Due to the nature of the thesis, we would provide a brief
			summary of the core ideas used in this thesis in the appendices.
			We hope that this would make the thesis more accessible to readers
			of each of the fields.
